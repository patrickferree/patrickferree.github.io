    <h1>Patrick Landon Ferree</h1>
    <p>
        I am an aspiring philosopher and historian of science living in Copenhagen, DK. I am currently working on problems in the history and philosophy of cell and molecular biology.  I have also spent many years at the bench and in the field studying biology, but also aerosol chemistry and exposure science, among other things. Here is a copy of my <a href="patrickferreeCV2023.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
